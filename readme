🛠️ Tech Stack

* Frontend: React, Axios
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT (jsonwebtoken), bcryptjs
* Database: MongoDB

⚙️ Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Saketh9009/ExpenseTracker.git](https://github.com/Saketh9009/ExpenseTracker.git)

Navigate into the project directory:

cd mern-expense-tracker

2. Setup Backend

Navigate into the `backend` directory:

cd backend

Install the backend dependencies:

npm install

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:

PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here

* `PORT`: The port the backend server will run on (e.g., 5001).
* `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string. You can get this from MongoDB Atlas or your local MongoDB instance.
* `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, random string used for signing JWT tokens.

Start the backend server:

npm start

The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5001`.

3. Setup Frontend

Open a new terminal window and navigate into the `frontend` directory:

cd ../frontend

Install the frontend dependencies:

npm install

Start the frontend development server:

npm start

The React application should now open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

🚀 Usage

1.  Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.
3.  Start tracking your expenses!
